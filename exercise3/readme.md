# Exercise 3: Custom List Sorting 📈

## 📃 Problem Statement 📝

Write a Python function `custom_sort(lst)` that sorts a list of integers such that all even numbers come before all odd numbers, and both even and odd numbers are sorted in ascending order.

* E.g.: `lst = [5, 8, 6, 7, 3]` should be sorted to `[6, 8, 3, 5, 7]`

## 📖 Learning Objective 📘
- Understand list manipulation
- Learn custom sorting techniques

## ☝🏻 Instructions ✌🏻
1. Complete the `custom_sort(lst)` function in `exercise3.py`.
2. (Optional) Run the test cases in `test3.py` to ensure your function works correctly.
3. Push your changes to the repository.

## 📑 Accessing Test Reports 🧾
An HTML report and a coverage report will be generated on push or pull request, and can be found by following the steps bellow:
1. Navigate to the *Actions* tab of your repository 
```jsx
https://github.com/Northeastern-University-SV/<name_of_repository_created>/actions
```
* Note: Replace `name_of_repository_created` with your repository.  
2. Find the workflow run for your latest push.
3. Download the `test-report` and `coverage-report` artifacts.

## 📲 Real-World Application 🤳🏻 
Custom sorting is widely used in data analysis, database management, and user interface design to organize data efficiently.
