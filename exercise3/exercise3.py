# Welcome to Exercise 3!
# Let's sort a list such that all even numbers come before all odd numbers.

def custom_sort(lst):
    # TODO: Sort the list such that even numbers come before odd numbers
    # Hint: Use list comprehensions and sorted()
    return # placeholder

# Example usage:
# print(custom_sort([4, 1, 3, 2]))  # Expected output: [2, 4, 1, 3]
